The code will find the importance for predicting variables, using random forest. 

Runing:
The program will run through multiple  leaf sizes to find the best size. Looking at error rates of the random forests.

Output:
It will produce 3 plots. The first is the best tree for prediction. The second is the error rate over time for the trees for different leaf sizes. The third will be the level of importance for each variable.
